# UFO-Webpage
Dynamic web page using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js

## Automatic Table and Date Search


Using the UFO dataset![data.js](./static/js/data.js) , write code that appends a table to your web page ([html webpage](./index.html)) and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * There is a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.


Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
